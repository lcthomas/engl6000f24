# Course Requirements & Expectations
## Attendance and Active Participation
There is no assigned reading for this course, but just as with any graduate seminar, its success depends on your participation. As with any graduate course, you are expected to arrive on time for, attend, and actively participate in every class period, barring emergencies or illness. If you are someone for whom participation in class is difficult, I am here to help you work on these skills. Please talk to me about strategies for increasing your participation.

While I expect you to attend every class session (barring illness or emergency), life sometimes gets in the way. Missing one class session is ok, and if you know you will be absent on any given day, please let me know. If you expect to miss more than one class session this semester, or if you find yourself in a situation where you will miss more than one class session, please make sure to communicate this with me. This communication is about building accountability as a member of our class community, and it's also about keeping the communication channels open so that we can work together to ensure you stay up to date in this class and in your other classes.

## S/U Grading
This course is graded on a "Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory" scale. To receive a "Satisfactory" grade, you will:
- Attend and participate in all class sessions but one, barring illness or emergency;
- Complete your journal review presentation;
- Meet with me at least once by the end of week 10 of the semester (I will set aside extra time during weeks 9 and 10 for this purpose, but I am happy to meet with you at any time before this, too).

## Communication
Please communicate with me if things come up about your experience of the course and/or your first semester, especially if you find yourself overwhelmed. I see it as part of my job as Director of Graduate Studies to help you adjust to and navigate graduate school and to the program, insofar as I am able. I am happy to meet with you in office hours or in a meeting outside of office hours.

## Accommodations and Accessibility
It is important to me that you can access this course. If you anticipate or experience barriers to actively participating in or completing your work in this class due to a disability or for any other reason, please let me know early in the semester so that we can discuss options. While I do want you to communicate with me, it is not necessary to divulge the nature of your disability or personal experience.
